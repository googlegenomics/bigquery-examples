How to contribute to genomics-bigquery
===================================

Thank you for wanting to contribute!

Contributor License Agreements
------------------------------

All pull requests are welcome. Before we can submit them though, there is a legal hurdle we have to jump. You'll need to fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
  own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an `individual CLA
  <https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual>`_.
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
  then you'll need to sign a `corporate CLA
  <https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate>`_.

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.


Submitting a pull request
-------------------------

Github provides a nice `overview on how to create a pull request
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request>`_.

Some general rules to follow:

* Do your work in `a fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_ of the genomics-bigquery repo.
* Create a branch for each update that you're working on. 
  These branches are often called "feature" or "topic" branches. Any changes
  that you push to your feature branch will automatically be shown in the pull request.
* Keep your pull requests as small as possible. Large pull requests are hard to review. 
  Try to break up your changes into self-contained and incremental pull requests.
* The first line of commit messages should be a short (<80 character) summary, 
  followed by an empty line and then any details that you want to share about the commit.
* Please try to follow the existing syntax style
