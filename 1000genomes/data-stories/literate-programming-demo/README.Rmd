Literate Programming with R and BigQuery
========================================================

R Markdown Introduction
-------------------------

This is an R Markdown document. [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).  Markdown can also be used to [author slides](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/presentations/overview).

When you click the [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document (but see [the caveat](#caveat) later in this document).  You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r default data, comment=NA}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot example, fig.align="center", fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

Analysis
--------------

Now let us move onto [literate programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) for [BigQuery](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/).

If you have never used the [bigrquery](https://github.com/hadley/bigrquery) package before, you will likely need to do something like the following to get it installed:

```{r one time setup, eval=FALSE}
### Only needed the first time around
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("assertthat")
devtools::install_github("bigrquery")
```

<a id="caveat">_Caveat: Be advised that the bigrquery package will initiate the OAuth dance for you via redirection to your browser.  This is pretty handy, but that means you will want to run a query interactively from the R prompt the very first time around so that it can cache your credentials.  After that you can knit via the [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) Knit HTML button or via `require(knitr); knit("./1000genomes/data-stories/literate-programming-demo/README.Rmd", encoding="UTF-8");`._</a>

Next we will load our needed packages into our session:
```{r initialize}
library(bigrquery)
library(ggplot2)
```

And pull in the SQL for an interesting query:
```{r sql, comment=NA}
sql <- readChar("../../sql/minimum-allelic-frequency-by-ethnicity.sql",
               nchars=1e6)
cat(sql)
```

We will execute our query, bringing the results down to our R session for further examination:
```{r exec}
project <- "google.com:biggene" # put your projectID here
result <- query_exec(sql, project)
```

Let us examine our query result:
```{r result, comment=NA}
head(result)
summary(result)
str(result)
```
We can see that we have a row for each sample, with counts for the sample's variants four buckets based upon the allelic frequncy of each variant.


Data Visualization
-------------------
Some data visualization will help us to see more clearly the pattern resident within the results:
```{r viz, fig.align="center", fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
ggplot(result, aes(x=population, y=common_variant, fill=super_population)) + geom_boxplot() + ylab("Count of common variants per sample") + ggtitle("Common Variants (Minimum Allelic Frequency 5%)")
```
and now its clear to see that the ethnicities within the African super population have a much higher rate of mutation compared to the other ethnicities.


Provenance
-------------------
Lastly, let us capture version information about R and loaded packages for the sake of provenance.
```{r provenance, comment=NA}
sessionInfo()
```
